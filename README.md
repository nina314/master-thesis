# Dynamic K-Center Algorithms - Experimental Part

This repository is a work in progress and contains experimental components developed as part of my upcoming master's thesis on Dynamic K-Center Algorithms.

The objectives of the master thesis are as follows:
- To improve the existing theoretical bounds for the partially dynamic setting of the K-center problem.
- (Featured in this repository) To empirically compare the dynamic algorithms based on the paper "[Fully Dynamic k-Center Clustering in Doubling Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03948)" with existing static and dynamic algorithms for computing K-center on graphs (e.g., "[Quick k-Median, k-Center, and Facility Location for Sparse Graphs](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539701388884?journalCode=smjcat)").

The final results and comparisons will be available in the `runtime_cost_analysis` notebook, while all algorithms will be implemented in C++.
